                                 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <code>&lt;OrderedList&gt;</code> element describes an ordered list of items. These are used for numbered sub-provisions where the hierarchy
                                    of numbered subprovisions is broken, such as in a definition list - except for in
                                    tables, where <code>&lt;P<i>n</i>&gt;</code> elements are still used.</p>
                                 				
                                 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ordered lists should not be confused with provisions. Provisions are numbered paragraphs,
                                    whereas ordered lists are semantically grouped paragraphs.</p>
                                 				
                                 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The schema takes the approach that if there is a break in the hierarchy of the provisions
                                    then any subsequent structure must be a list. This typically occurs where defined
                                    terms contain numbered items. These should be done as ordered lists within unordered
                                    lists, i.e. the defined term is an entry in an unordered list. Subsequently the chain
                                    of numbered provisions is broken and any children must be ordered lists. This approach
                                    comes from the schema provisions as being controlled by the indent of the provisions.</p>
